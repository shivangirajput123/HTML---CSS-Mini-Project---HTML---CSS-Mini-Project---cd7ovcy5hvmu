# html-css-project- "Registration Form"

This project contains input of user details and a submission button as example name, address and phone number.
Skills I have used in this:-
-HTML
-CSS
 
I have used html for creating the context of the user details in separate divisions and it has a form formation by which users easily fill their input.
 
In CSS part, I have used flex property and also i have highlighted the input box by using focus and valid property. I have given a gradient look to the submission button by using the linear-gradient property.
 
Note: Used google font import for font styling.
